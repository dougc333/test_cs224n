1) session variable is in index.html without having to pass variable through render_template fn. 
2) convention of set_background vs. set-background for url https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/url-structure 
google url naming says use set-background or hyphen in url name. Python route names have hyphen. To make this convention work 
name the function with an underscore. app.route('set-foo)
