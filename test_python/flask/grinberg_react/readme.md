# Example of a python react config

Careful. Not for production. I don't recommend this because of regression testing of Flask and React. Neither framework endorses the other and they aren't tested together either as part of a framework or indewpendently. NextJS doesn;t incluse flask in their development of RSC and it is the recommended framework for new projects. 

Safer to run jinja/Flask as an API server with NextJS as a separte stack. Not saving dev time by fofcing flask to adopt React and leaving out Jinja.
