up to ch4. add mods here. 
db insert works in webservice >flask run
db insert doesnt work in python CLI. app.app_context() errror. WOrked in other revisions? 
something wrong with setup. maybe FLASK_APP not set. 
this is the min you need to run 
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade

then check test.db file and verify 
cd instance
sqlite3 test.db
.tables
.schema user
insert into user(id,username,email, age) values(1, "bob", "bob@example.com", 10);
select * from user;
1|bob|bob@example.com|10
