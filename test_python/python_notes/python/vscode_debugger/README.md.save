vscode debugger launch.json you specify the executable when using click/setup.py. click copies
yourscript to venv/bin/yourscript. Set the location to this file. which is the click entry point when 
it calls pkg_resources load_entry_point. 
pdb works

test using command in args:[] and debug open file
${worspaceFolder}/y train
and 
${workspaceFolder}/y
args:['train']

do these really work in vscode? I cant get them to work in pytext. 
this works with this launch.json. This enters the debugger but 
what happens and how do you enter the train subcommand? 
   {
      "name": "Python: Current File (Integrated Terminal)",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/subcommands/y.py",
      "console": "integratedTerminal"
    },

set breakpoint in main() of y.py
when we run teh commnnd normally >y without the train subcommand we dont get the print
statemnt in main() and the train subcommand. We just get teh help menu: 

(venv_vscode) dougchang@Dougs-MacBook-Pro:~/TDS/python/vscode_debugger/subcommands$ y
Usage: y [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --config-file TEXT
  --config-json TEXT
  --config-module TEXT  python module that contains the config object
  --help                Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  train

But when we run >y train awe get the correct output and the functions execute>
  train
(venv_vscode) dougchang@Dougs-MacBook-Pro:~/TDS/python/vscode_debugger/subcommands$ y train
main
init running
train subcommand a_option: 

so this means we need to get the subcommand train correct for the debugger to execute the main() and train() functions
and if train() doesnt execute then main() doesnt execute eiteher. 


One way to solve this which is not on websearch sites is to modify y. click() and setuptools copys y which is a python program 
to an executable under venv/bin/y so modify this by adding "train" or the 
subcommand to the sys.argv list. Cant rely on args in vscode to append to 
sys.argv since it cant do so when the process is under control of click and setuptools
