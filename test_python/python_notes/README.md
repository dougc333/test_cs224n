# Python Lectures for DS and ML

Python vs. GoLang. 

Python: how to productionize vectorized operations. 
GOLANG: how to allocate memory heap vs stack and channels for request processing

Ignore async for now
Compare vectorized Python vs. GOLANG not nonvectorized python. If not in a DS application then vectorized may not be relevant.
